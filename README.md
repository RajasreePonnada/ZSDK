### Project: "ZK-Verified Decentralized Identity Management with AvailDA"

#### Concept:
Decentralized identity management system that leverages AvailDA's expandable blobspace, Polygon CDK, RISC Zero zkVM, and light clients to create a secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution.
#### Key Components:

#### AvailDA Integration:

Utilizes AvailDA's blobspace to store encrypted identity data, ensuring high availability and data integrity.
Leverages AvailDA's expandable nature to accommodate growing identity datasets efficiently.


#### Polygon CDK:

Build a custom rollup using Polygon CDK, optimized for identity management operations.
Implements smart contracts for identity creation, verification, and management.


#### RISC Zero zkVM:

Use RISC Zero zkVM to generate zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification without revealing sensitive information.
Implements privacy-preserving computations for identity attributes and claims.


#### Light Client Verification:

A light client for end-users to verify their identity data posted by the sequencer on AvailDA.
Ensures quick and efficient verification of identity claims without downloading the entire dataset.


#### Decentralized Identity Standards:

Implements support for decentralized identity standards like DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials).


#### User Interface:

Creates a user-friendly interface for managing digital identities, including creation, updates, and revocations.
(TBD)

#### Integration APIs:

Develop APIs for third-party services to integrate with the identity management system securely.



#### Key Benefits:

Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that users can prove their identity without revealing unnecessary information.
Scalability: AvailDA's expandable blobspace allows the system to grow with increasing users and data.
Security: Combination of AvailDA, zkVM, and light client verification provides multiple layers of security.
Interoperability: Support for decentralized identity standards ensures compatibility with other systems.
Cost-efficiency: Utilizes AvailDA's cheap data availability layer for storing large amounts of identity data.

#### Use Cases:

KYC/AML for DeFi platforms
Age verification for online services
Educational credential verification
Professional certification management
Decentralized reputation systems

#### This project idea addresses several critical aspects of the competition:

It meaningfully utilizes AvailDA's expandable blobspace for storing identity data.
It improves developer/user experience in the Avail ecosystem by providing a crucial identity management service.
It incorporates RISC Zero zkVM for privacy-preserving computations.
It uses Polygon CDK to create a custom rollup optimized for identity management.
It implements light client verification to ensure data integrity and user trust.
